# Austin_AniML_Rescue_ArlenaWu
Austin_AniML_Rescue was a machine learning project that took data from the Austin Animal Center in order to determine what factors most impacted the outcomes of cats and dogs who passed through the shelter.

This page was written to give further insight into my personal contributions to the Austin_AniML_Rescue project, and machine learning-focused project that I worked on with my teammates Ilaha Cardoso, Sarah Griffin, Melinda Malone, and Ruth Ordeo. To see the full, original project, please visit the link here: https://github.com/ilaha/Austin_AniML_Rescue

The files included in this repository are the ones that I primarily worked on. I had the critical role of developing the machine learning models, as well as performing the initial exploratory data analysis, and cleaning/prepping the data to feed into the models.
